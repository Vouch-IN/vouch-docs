title: 'MX Records Verification'
description: 'Verify domain mail server configuration'
---

## Overview

MX (Mail Exchange) record verification checks whether the email domain has properly configured mail servers in its DNS records. Without valid MX records, a domain cannot receive emails.

<Note>
  This is typically configured as a **BLOCK** check since emails to domains without MX records will always bounce.

## What Are MX Records?

MX records are DNS entries that specify which mail servers handle email for a domain. When someone sends an email to `user@example.com`, the sending server looks up the MX records for `example.com` to find where to deliver the message.

## API Response

```json
{
  "checks": {
    "mx": {
      "pass": true,
      "latency": 45.3
    }
  }
}
```

For unreachable MX servers:

```json
{
  "checks": {
    "mx": {
      "pass": true,
      "latency": 120.1,
      "error": "mx_unreachable"
    }
  }
}
```

<ParamField path="pass" type="boolean">
  Whether the domain has valid MX records
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="latency" type="number">
  DNS lookup time in milliseconds
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="error" type="string">
