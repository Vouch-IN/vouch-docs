  **Coming Soon** - Catch-all detection is currently in development and will be available in a future release.

## Overview

Catch-all detection identifies email domains configured to accept mail for any address, regardless of whether the mailbox actually exists. This makes it impossible to verify if a specific email address is valid.

## What is a Catch-All Domain?

A catch-all (or accept-all) domain is configured to accept emails sent to any address at that domain, even non-existent ones. The domain's mail server responds with "250 OK" to all recipient addresses during SMTP verification.

### Example Behavior

```smtp
# Testing random addresses on a catch-all domain
RCPT TO:<realuser@company.com>
250 OK ✓

RCPT TO:<definitely-fake-12345@company.com>
250 OK ✓  # Still accepts!

RCPT TO:<random-gibberish-xyz@company.com>
250 OK ✓  # Accepts everything!
```
