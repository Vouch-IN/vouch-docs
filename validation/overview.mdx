## Email Validation Strategy

Vouch performs 9 different validation checks on every email address to ensure comprehensive fraud detection and email quality assurance. Each validation type can be individually configured to either **allow**, **flag**, or **block** based on your requirements.

## Validation Categories

### Email Format Validation

These checks verify the email address itself is valid and deliverable:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Syntax Validation" icon="code">
    Ensures the email conforms to RFC 5322 standards. This is the most basic check that catches obvious typos and malformed addresses.

    **Common failures:**
    - Missing @ symbol
    - Invalid characters
    - Malformed domain
    - Missing local or domain part
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MX Records" icon="server">
    Verifies that the email domain has valid mail exchange (MX) records configured in DNS. Without MX records, the domain cannot receive emails.

    **What it checks:**
    - DNS MX record existence
    - At least one valid mail server
    - Proper DNS configuration
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SMTP Verification" icon="envelope">
    Performs an actual SMTP handshake with the mail server to verify the specific mailbox exists without sending an email.

    **What it checks:**
    - Connects to mail server
    - Verifies recipient mailbox
    - No email actually sent
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Quality & Risk Detection

These checks identify potentially problematic or risky email addresses:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Disposable Email Detection" icon="trash">
    Identifies temporary email services like Mailinator, Guerrilla Mail, or 10minutemail. These are often used for spam, fraud, or to avoid long-term commitment.

    **Database includes:**
    - 5,000+ known disposable domains
    - Regular updates for new services
    - Pattern-based detection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Catch-all Detection" icon="inbox">
    Identifies domains configured to accept all emails regardless of whether the specific mailbox exists. This makes it impossible to verify if a user actually owns the email.

    **Why it matters:**
    - Can't verify mailbox exists
    - Often used for spam collection
    - Higher fraud risk
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Role Email Detection" icon="user-group">
    Detects generic organizational emails like admin@, support@, or info@ rather than personal email addresses.

    **Common roles detected:**
    - admin, administrator
    - support, help, service
    - info, contact, sales
    - noreply, no-reply
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Alias Detection" icon="at">
    Identifies plus-addressing (user+tag@domain.com) which allows one email address to create unlimited variations.

    **Why it matters:**
    - Bypass "one email per account" limits
    - Makes user tracking harder
    - Can indicate abuse patterns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Fraud & Device Detection

These checks identify patterns associated with fraudulent behavior:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Device Fingerprinting" icon="fingerprint">
    Creates a unique fingerprint of the user's device to track it across multiple signups. Detects when the same device is used to create many accounts.

    **Signals collected:**
    - Browser fingerprint (99.5% accurate)
    - Canvas fingerprinting
    - WebGL fingerprinting
    - Audio context fingerprinting
    - Hardware signals
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="IP Reputation" icon="shield-halved">
    Analyzes the user's IP address to detect VPNs, Tor networks, proxies, data centers, and known fraudulent IPs.

    **Threats detected:**
    - VPN services
    - Tor exit nodes
    - Proxy servers
    - Data center IPs
    - Known fraud networks
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Validation Works

### Parallel Execution

All validation checks run in parallel for maximum speed:

```typescript
// Conceptual flow
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
  validateSyntax(email),
  checkDisposable(email),
  verifyMX(domain),
  checkSMTP(email),
  detectCatchall(domain),
  detectRole(email),
  detectAlias(email),
  fingerprintDevice(signals),
  checkIPReputation(ip)
]);
```

### Early Exit Strategy

Vouch uses an intelligent early-exit strategy:

<Steps>
  <Step title="BLOCK checks use Promise.race()">
    If any BLOCK-configured check fails, validation can exit early without waiting for other checks
  </Step>
  <Step title="FLAG checks run to completion">
    All FLAG and ALLOW checks run fully to gather maximum intelligence
  </Step>
  <Step title="Results aggregated">
    All signals combined into final recommendation: allow, flag, or block
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuration per Check

Each validation type can be configured independently:

| Action | Behavior | When to Use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ALLOW** | Check runs but doesn't affect recommendation | Gathering data only |
| **FLAG** | Failure marks email as suspicious | Review recommended |
| **BLOCK** | Failure immediately blocks email | Critical checks |

## Validation Response Structure

Each validation returns a consistent structure:

```typescript
{
  "syntax": {
    "valid": true,
    "action": "block",
    "message": "Email format is valid"
  },
  "disposable": {
    "valid": false,
    "action": "block",
    "domain": "tempmail.com",
    "message": "Disposable email detected"
  },
  "mx": {
    "valid": true,
    "action": "block",
    "records": ["mx1.example.com", "mx2.example.com"],
    "message": "MX records found"
  }
  // ... other validations
}
```

### Field Definitions

<ParamField path="valid" type="boolean">
  Whether the check passed (true) or failed (false)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="action" type="string">
  The configured action for this check: `allow`, `flag`, or `block`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  Human-readable description of the result
</ParamField>

Additional fields vary by validation type and provide specific details about what was detected.

## Recommendation Logic

The final recommendation is determined by aggregating all validation signals:

```typescript
if (anyBlockChecksFailedAndConfiguredToBlock) {
  return "block";
} else if (anyFlagChecksFailedAndConfiguredToFlag) {
  return "flag";
} else {
  return "allow";
}
```

### Recommendation Values

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="allow" icon="check" color="#10b981">
    Email passed all checks. Safe to proceed with account creation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="flag" icon="flag" color="#f59e0b">
    Suspicious signals detected. Consider manual review or additional verification.
  </Card>
  <Card title="block" icon="ban" color="#ef4444">
    Critical validation failed. Reject this email address.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Default Configuration

By default, Vouch uses this configuration:

| Validation | Default Action | Rationale |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Syntax | BLOCK | Invalid format cannot receive email |
| Disposable | BLOCK | Temporary emails indicate fraud |
| MX Records | BLOCK | No mail server means undeliverable |
| SMTP | FLAG | Some valid emails may fail SMTP |
| Catch-all | FLAG | Reduces confidence but not always fraud |
| Role Email | ALLOW | Often legitimate but worth tracking |
| Alias | FLAG | Can indicate multi-accounting |
| Device Fingerprint | FLAG | Multiple accounts may be legitimate |
| IP Reputation | FLAG | VPNs used legitimately by some users |

<Note>
  You can customize these settings per project in your Vouch dashboard.
</Note>

## Performance Characteristics
