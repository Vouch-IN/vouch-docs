## Email Validation Strategy

Vouch performs multiple validation checks on every email address to ensure comprehensive fraud detection and email quality assurance. Each validation type can be individually configured to either **allow**, **flag**, or **block** based on your requirements.

## Validation Categories

### Email Format Validation

These checks verify the email address itself is valid and deliverable:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Syntax Validation" icon="code">
    Ensures the email conforms to RFC 5322 standards. This is the most basic check that catches obvious typos and malformed addresses.

    **Common failures:**
    - Missing @ symbol
    - Invalid characters
    - Malformed domain
    - Missing local or domain part
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MX Records" icon="server">
    Verifies that the email domain has valid mail exchange (MX) records configured in DNS. Without MX records, the domain cannot receive emails.

    **What it checks:**
    - DNS MX record existence
    - At least one valid mail server
    - Proper DNS configuration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Quality & Risk Detection

These checks identify potentially problematic or risky email addresses:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Disposable Email Detection" icon="trash">
    Identifies temporary email services like Mailinator, Guerrilla Mail, or 10minutemail. These are often used for spam, fraud, or to avoid long-term commitment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Role Email Detection" icon="user-group">
    Detects generic organizational emails like admin@, support@, or info@ rather than personal email addresses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Alias Detection" icon="at">
    Identifies plus-addressing (user+tag@domain.com) which allows one email address to create unlimited variations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Fraud & Device Detection

These checks identify patterns associated with fraudulent behavior:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Device Fingerprinting" icon="fingerprint">
    Creates a unique fingerprint of the user's device to track it across multiple signups. Detects when the same device is used to create many accounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="IP Reputation" icon="shield-halved">
    Analyzes the user's IP address to detect VPNs, Tor networks, proxies, data centers, and known fraudulent IPs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Validation Works

All validation checks run in parallel for maximum speed. Vouch uses an intelligent early-exit strategy where BLOCK-configured checks can terminate validation early, while FLAG and ALLOW checks run to completion to gather maximum intelligence.

### Configuration per Check

Each validation type can be configured independently:

| Action | Behavior | When to Use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ALLOW** | Check runs but doesn't affect recommendation | Gathering data only |
| **FLAG** | Failure marks email as suspicious | Review recommended |
| **BLOCK** | Failure immediately blocks email | Critical checks |

## Validation Response Structure

Each validation returns a consistent structure with the following fields:

### Field Definitions

<ParamField path="valid" type="boolean">
  Whether the check passed (true) or failed (false)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="action" type="string">
  The configured action for this check: `allow`, `flag`, or `block`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  Human-readable description of the result
</ParamField>

Additional fields vary by validation type and provide specific details about what was detected.

## Recommendation Logic

The final recommendation is determined by aggregating all validation signals. If any BLOCK-configured check fails, the recommendation is "block". If any FLAG-configured check fails, the recommendation is "flag". Otherwise, the recommendation is "allow".

### Recommendation Values

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="allow" icon="check" color="#10b981">
    Email passed all checks. Safe to proceed with account creation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="flag" icon="flag" color="#f59e0b">
    Suspicious signals detected. Consider manual review or additional verification.
  </Card>
  <Card title="block" icon="ban" color="#ef4444">
    Critical validation failed. Reject this email address.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Default Configuration

By default, Vouch uses this configuration:

| Validation | Default Action | Rationale |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Syntax | BLOCK | Invalid format cannot receive email |
| Disposable | BLOCK | Temporary emails indicate fraud |
| MX Records | BLOCK | No mail server means undeliverable |
| Role Email | ALLOW | Often legitimate but worth tracking |
| Alias | FLAG | Can indicate multi-accounting |
| Device Fingerprint | FLAG | Multiple accounts may be legitimate |
| IP Reputation | FLAG | VPNs used legitimately by some users |

## Performance Characteristics

- **Average validation time:** 150-300ms
- **Early exit scenarios:** 50-150ms
- **Full validation:** 300-500ms

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Conservative" icon="gauge">
    Begin with more checks set to FLAG rather than BLOCK. Review flagged accounts to understand your user base before tightening restrictions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combine with Other Signals" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Use Vouch validation alongside your own business logic and risk scoring for the most comprehensive fraud prevention.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
