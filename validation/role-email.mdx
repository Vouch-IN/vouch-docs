description: 'Detect generic organizational email addresses'

## Overview

Role email detection identifies generic organizational email addresses like admin@, support@, or info@ that belong to a group or function rather than an individual person. These addresses typically indicate lower engagement and may not be suitable for personal accounts.

<Note>
  Typically configured as **ALLOW** or **FLAG** since role emails can be legitimate for business signups.
</Note>

## What Are Role Emails?

Role emails are addresses associated with a function or role within an organization rather than a specific person:

- `admin@company.com` - Administration
- `support@company.com` - Customer support
- `info@company.com` - General inquiries
- `sales@company.com` - Sales team
- `noreply@company.com` - Automated systems
