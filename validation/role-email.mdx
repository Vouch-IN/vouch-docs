description: 'Detect generic organizational email addresses'
---

## Overview

Role email detection identifies generic organizational email addresses like admin@, support@, or info@ that belong to a group or function rather than an individual person.

<Note>
  Typically configured as **ALLOW** or **FLAG** since role emails can be legitimate for business signups.
</Note>

## Common Role Prefixes

- `admin@` - Administration
- `support@` - Customer support
- `info@` - General inquiries
- `sales@` - Sales team
- `noreply@` - Automated systems
- `contact@` - Contact forms

## Why Detect Role Emails

- **Lower engagement**: Shared inboxes have lower engagement rates
- **Not personal**: Can't identify a specific individual
- **Compliance**: Some services require personal email addresses
