## Why Vouch?

### Comprehensive Protection

Vouch doesn't just check email syntax. We perform 9 different validation checks including:

- **Syntax validation** - Ensure proper email format
- **Disposable email detection** - Block temporary email services
- **MX record verification** - Confirm domain has mail servers
- **SMTP validation** - Verify the mailbox actually exists
- **Catch-all detection** - Identify domains that accept all emails
- **Role email detection** - Flag admin@, support@, etc.
- **Alias detection** - Detect plus-addressing (user+tag@domain.com)
- **Device fingerprinting** - Track device reuse across emails
- **IP reputation** - Detect VPNs, proxies, and fraud

### Edge-Powered Performance

Built on Cloudflare Workers, Vouch delivers validation results in milliseconds from data centers worldwide. Our smart parallel validation architecture exits early on blocking checks while gathering comprehensive signals.

## Key Features

### Smart Validation Strategy

Vouch uses an intelligent "early exit" strategy:
- **BLOCK checks** use `Promise.race()` - returns on first failure
- **FLAG checks** run to completion for maximum insight
- Minimizes latency while maximizing data quality

### Flexible Configuration

Configure validation behavior per project:
- Enable/disable individual validation checks
- Set custom risk thresholds
- Whitelist/blacklist domains
- Customize recommendations

### Rich Analytics

Track validation metrics over time:
- Device type distribution
- Geographic patterns
- Threat signal statistics
- Usage trends

### Enterprise-Ready

- **Rate limiting** - 1,000/hr (client) or 5,000/hr (server)
- **Quota management** - Subscription-based limits with grace periods
- **Webhook notifications** - Real-time updates on validation events
- **Team management** - Invite team members with role-based access
