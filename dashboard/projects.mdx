<Tabs>

    | Catch-all | BLOCK | Cannot verify mailbox |
    | Role Email | BLOCK | Require personal emails |

```

**Staging:**
```
staging.yourdomain.com
*.staging.yourdomain.com
```

**Production:**
```
yourdomain.com

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Name projects clearly:

    ```
    ✅ Good:
    - "MyApp - Production"
    - "Mobile App - iOS"
    - "Client Portal - Staging"

    ❌ Bad:
    - "Project 1"
    - "Test"
    - "asdf"

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configure Domains Carefully" icon="shield">

  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Set up alerts for:
