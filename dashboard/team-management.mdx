## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot Invite Member" icon="envelope">
    **Issue:** Invitation fails to send

    **Causes:**
    - Team limit reached for plan
    - Invalid email address
    - User already has pending invitation
    - User already in project

    **Solutions:**
    - Check team member count vs plan limit
    - Verify email address format
    - Cancel existing invitations
    - Upgrade plan if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission Denied" icon="ban">
    **Issue:** Team member can't access feature

    **Causes:**
    - Insufficient role permissions
    - 2FA not enabled
    - IP not in allowlist
    - Session expired

    **Solutions:**
    - Check role permissions matrix
    - Enable 2FA if required
    - Connect from allowed IP
    - Re-authenticate
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot Remove Owner" icon="crown">
    **Issue:** Cannot remove the last owner

    **Cause:** Projects require at least one owner

    **Solution:**
    1. Promote another member to Owner
    2. Then remove original owner
    3. Or transfer project ownership
